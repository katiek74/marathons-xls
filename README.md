### Nashville Rock-and-Roll Marathon and Half-Marathon Race Results (2016 - 2019)

This was our first team project where we used Excel to analyze data from the Nashville Rock-and-Roll Marathons and presented various statistics from our findings. In investigating the reason for slower times by the runners in 2017, I researched the temperature and dewpoint for each year of the race and discovered that 2017 was a particularly hot and muggy year.
